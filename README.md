This is a source code for the paper "On Approx-SVP in multiquadratic ideal lattices".

It is built on top of the implementation of the Biasse-van Vredendaal algorithm for the class group computation for real multiquadratic fields:
* https://scarecryptow.org/publications/multiclass.html 
and on it's adaptation to the imaginary multiquadratic fields from:
* https://github.com/novoselov-sa/multiclass-im

# Requirements
* Sage 10.0+

# How to compile
1. Run ```make```
2. Edit paths in Makefile according to your installation if code above fails.

# Folder and files structure
* tests/ - lightweight unit tests
* trees/ - trees describing prime ideal splitting over subfields. Factor base is loaded from these files. They are generated by ```trees_generation.sage``` script.
* relations/ - class group relation matrices for every subfield. They are generated by ```testrelations.sage``` script.

Files ```*_test.sage``` contain expensive tests and tests that requires precomputations.

# How to use
1. Run ```sage trees_generation.sage d_1 d_2 ... d_n``` to generate a factor base.
2. Run ```sage testrelations.sage``` to compute class group and relation matrices for subfields.
3. Run ```sage dlog_cyc_rat.sage``` to compute discrete logarithm for a random ideal.
4. Run ```sage ideal_asvp.sage n``` to compute a short element of the ideal.

To run experiments described in the paper, execute one of scripts ```experiments/asvp_d{field_degree}*.sh'''.
